## Description
Citygen is a set of tools to automatically generate random 2D 
maps of medieval cities, which are then converted into 3D scenes
and videogames.

The scripts are mainly written in [python3](https://www.python.org), 
models are generated with [blender3D](https://www.blender.org) and
games are playable using blenderplayer.

Most of the artwork has been done by external artists that have released
their work in several domain licenses. Please refer to the Readme.txt file
bundled inside of each .blend file to get detailed info about their authors 
and licenses applyed to their work. If you feel that you are owner of any 
artwork used here, send me a message.

Some nice values for randomSeed:
* ./cityGen2D.py  --randomSeed 10
* ./cityGen2D.py -s 30 --randomSeed 47932
